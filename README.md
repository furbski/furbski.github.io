# lyrebird.audio
This is the temporary website I will host at lyrebird.audio until I work out a good way to implement what I want into Netlify+Hugo.

Simple HTML is the minimum viable solution to hosting a portfolio, whereas the planned implementation will be able to handle forms, logins, large media, and quickly adding new content.

Since my strategy is to build a reputation through self hosted and published content, this is going to be necessary in the coming months and years, but for now I just need to be able to point people to a portfolio.

The new version will be available at lyrebird.netlify.app until I migrate to the lyrebird.audio domain.
